This is how sales productivity AI agents are finally fixing that broken process and what it means for your team’s ability to drive revenue.\n\nSummarized by [Writer](https://writer.com/)\n\n*   The traditional sales prospecting model doesn’t work anymore — it forces reps into months of manual, inefficient research that leads to burnout and delayed revenue.\n*   This inefficiency creates significant hidden costs, including unreliable forecasts, high seller turnover, and a fragmented, underutilized tech stack.\n*   The solution requires shifting from managing manual tasks to automating entire end-to-end prospecting workflows.\n*   Sales productivity AI agents execute these complex workflows autonomously, handling everything from territory planning and research to personalized outreach.\n*   By eliminating administrative work, AI agents empower sellers to become strategic advisors, dramatically increasing prospecting velocity and driving measurable pipeline growth.\n\n![Image 5](https://writer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ic.svg?w=335)\n\nThere’s a moment I think every sales leader can recognize — handing a brand-new, ambitious Account Executive (AE) a spreadsheet with hundreds of accounts and telling them to tier their accounts and build a territory plan. For years, I saw this as a rite of passage. I thought I was giving them autonomy, a chance to own their success from day one.\n\nIt took me too long to realize that what I was actually giving them was two months of manual, soul-crushing homework. My attempt to empower them was, in reality, setting them up for failure before they ever made a single call. That moment of realization stuck with me because it’s a clear picture of a problem that quietly undermines our entire industry. It’s the true origin of the staggering 77% of time our best sellers lose to non-selling, administrative tasks. The traditional ramp-up period — once a standard onboarding process — has become a predictable cycle of burnout and delayed revenue.\n\nThe future of elite sales performance requires a new layer of intelligence that can automate the entire prospecting workflow from end to end. It’s time to arm our sellers with sales productivity AI agents that let them focus on what they were hired to do — sell.\n\nWhy is the traditional sales ramp broken?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nFor years, I accepted the long sales ramp as a necessary cost of doing business. But I eventually realized it wasn’t a process. It was a trap. It relied on a series of flawed assumptions that forced my reps to spend their most valuable time on the least valuable work. I saw this play out in three distinct stages.\n\n### Conventional methods provide data without direction\n\nThe process begins with an illusion. We’d hand a new rep a list of accounts, often a raw data dump from Salesforce, and call it a territory. In their hands, it became a puzzle with a thousand pieces and no picture on the box. Even with the best intent models, traditional territory management software falls short here. It organizes data beautifully but fails to answer the most critical question for a new rep: “Where do I start, and why?” This leaves them staring at a list, forced to begin the long, manual journey of finding the signal in the noise.\n\n### Standard practices demand countless hours of manual, fragmented research\n\nOnce a rep picked a handful of accounts to investigate, the real time-sink began. This was the soul-crushing, manual process of sifting through [LinkedIn profiles](https://writer.com/agents/executive-biography/), [10-Ks](https://writer.com/agents/10k-10q-summary/), [earnings call transcripts](https://writer.com/agents/earnings-call-summary/), and [press releases](https://writer.com/agents/press-release/). Each piece of information lived on a different platform, forcing reps to jump between dozens of B2B prospecting tools and browser tabs. This fragmented workflow is the very definition of inefficiency, burning days and weeks that could have been spent talking to customers.\n\n### The traditional process encourages guesswork over genuine insight\n\nAfter weeks of this grueling research, what was the result? An exhausted rep with a collection of disconnected facts instead of a deep, strategic insight. The manual effort is so draining that it leads to weak, generic hypotheses about buyer pain points. The initial hard work devolves into uninspired guesswork. The business impact is severe and predictable. The countless hours of work produce no tangible business impact on the pipeline for weeks or months.\n\nWhat are the hidden costs of sales inefficiency?\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe consequences of this slow, painful ramp-up eventually became impossible to ignore. What I once saw as a new-hire productivity issue, I now understood to be a systemic issue in how GTM leaders set their new hires up for failure. I felt the impact in three distinct ways.\n\n### Boardroom-level forecast anxiety\n\nThere is no worse feeling for a sales leader than sitting in a QBR, looking at a forecast you don’t trust. The deepest fear isn’t that the market has shifted — it’s that you’ll miss your number because of poor execution. When reps spend less than a third of their time actually selling, the data in your CRM becomes a lagging indicator of activity rather than a reliable predictor of revenue. This creates immense pressure from the rest of the C-suite to do more with less, and it fosters a perception that the [sales organization](https://writer.com/solutions/sales/) is bloated and undisciplined — a dangerous label in any economic climate.\n\n### The high price of seller burnout and turnover\n\nThe human cost is just as damaging. I’ve hired incredibly talented, driven AEs only to watch their motivation drain away as they spend their days copying and pasting data instead of building relationships and closing deals. Top performers leave because their work isn’t strategic, not because it’s too hard. They want to use their skills to solve customer problems, not drown in administrative tasks. I firmly believe that salespeople are some of the most creative folks out there. We need to help them use their time on creativity and not administrative burdens. This constant administrative burden is a leading cause of high turnover, forcing companies into a costly, repetitive cycle of hiring and [retraining](https://writer.com/blog/responsible-ai-adoption-and-training/).\n\n### A bloated, disconnected tech stack\n\nThe final hidden cost is the one sitting right in our budget — a tech stack that promises integration but delivers fragmentation. We’ve all spent years and millions of dollars investing in best-in-class tools like Salesforce, Gong, and Outreach. Yet, these platforms often create more silos. The underlying challenge is the absence of a true, intelligent CRM automation layer to connect the stack into a seamless workflow. Without it, our [expensive tech stack just becomes part of the problem](https://writer.com/blog/build-vs-buy-generative-ai/), turning a collection of powerful tools into a fragmented sales intelligence engine.\n\nHow can you shift sellers from administrative tasks to strategic work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI kept asking myself the same question: How do I get my reps to stop acting like researchers and start acting like sellers? I couldn’t just tell them to work faster or buy another point solution. I had to change the work itself. The solution became clear when I realized we had to stop managing tasks and start automating entire workflows. This meant embracing a new class of technology.\n\n### Move beyond task management to workflow automation\n\nThe first step is a mental shift. For too long, we’ve tried to solve the productivity problem by making reps faster at manual work. The real goal should be to eliminate administrative tasks entirely. This forced me to ask a fundamental question, “Why are my reps doing this research at all?” Their highest value lies in building relationships, understanding nuance, and thinking strategically. The moment we decide that our best people shouldn’t be doing low-level work, we open the door to real transformation.\n\n### Deploy an AI sales field productivity agent\n\nA new kind of technology powers this transformation — an [AI agent](https://writer.com/blog/ai-agents/). Think of it as more than a chatbot or a “copilot” that assists with a single step. An AI agent is an autonomous system designed to understand natural language commands and execute complex, multi-step sales workflows from start to finish. It can analyze a territory, identify high-potential accounts based on your ICP, conduct deep research across dozens of sources, and even draft personalized outreach. This is the foundation of true sales productivity AI — a system that manages the entire end-to-end process of field sales automation.\n\n### Elevate your reps into strategic advisors\n\nOnce the workflow is automated, the sales role fundamentally changes. With an AI agent handling the “how” of prospecting, your sellers are free to focus entirely on the “why” and the “who.” They shift from digging for data to analyzing insights and from building lists to building relationships. This allows them to apply their expertise to complex strategic frameworks like MEDDPICC, turning raw sales intelligence into a winning account planning AI strategy. You’re finally empowering them to be the strategic advisors you hired them to be.\n\nHow to transform the prospecting workflow with AI agents\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy long-standing vision as an Ops leader was to create a world where a new rep had everything they needed to succeed on day one, completely eliminating the ramp slog. I imagined an automated process capable of compressing months of manual research into a few hours. With the rise of true sales productivity AI agents, that vision is now a practical reality.\n\nLet me show you what that looks like in practice.\n\n### Step 1: Automate territory planning\n\nIt starts with a simple, natural language prompt from a sales manager to their AI agent:\n\n_“Build a territory plan for my new AE covering these 500 accounts, prioritizing for our ICP based on recent funding, hiring for engineering roles, and mentions of ‘data infrastructure’ in their earnings calls. Provide a fit score 1-100.”_\n\nInstead of spending weeks manually sorting a spreadsheet, the agent instantly analyzes the entire account list against the specific criteria of your Ideal Customer Profile. It connects to your CRM, external data sources, and financial news to rank and tier the accounts. Within minutes, the rep receives a fully prioritized territory map, transforming a mountain of data into a clear, actionable starting point. This is what modern territory management software should have been all along.\n\n### Step 2: Generate deep account research\n\nWith a prioritized list, the rep then directs the agent to the next step:\n\n_“For my Tier 1 accounts, generate a one-page summary on each, including key financials from their last 10-K, strategic initiatives mentioned in their last earnings call, and a list of VPs in the product and engineering departments.”_\n\nThe agent now performs the deep research that used to consume weeks of a rep’s time. It synthesizes information from dozens of disconnected B2B prospecting tools into a concise, strategic brief for each target account. The output is pure sales intelligence. The rep immediately understands why an account is a good fit, arming them with the context needed for a credible conversation. This is the core of effective account planning AI.\n\n### Step 3: Enhance research with interactive chatbot queries\n\nThe chatbot functionality allows reps to delve deeper into the research with real-time, interactive queries. For example, after receiving the initial one-page summary, a rep can ask questions like:\n\n_“Can you provide more details on the VP of Engineering’s recent projects and any challenges they might be facing?”_\n\n_“What are the key competitors of this company, and how do they compare in terms of market share and recent innovations?”_\n\nThis dynamic interaction ensures that reps can continuously refine their understanding and tailor their approach to each account, making the prospecting workflow more efficient, strategic, and insightful.\n\n### Step 4: Scale personalized outreach\n\nNow, the focus shifts from research to engagement. The rep can ask the agent: _“Draft three personalized outreach emails for the VP of Engineering at Acme Corp, referencing their recent focus on cloud migration and connecting it to our value proposition.”_\n\nThe agent uses the insights from its research to generate highly relevant, [non-generic outreach](https://writer.com/agents/personalized-client-outreach/). It moves beyond simple mail-merge fields to craft a narrative that speaks directly to the prospect’s known strategic priorities. The rep receives a ready-to-send starting point that they can review, refine, and send in minutes — a task that used to take hours — allowing them to connect with dozens of high-value prospects in a single afternoon.\n\n### Step 5: Deliver instant call prep\n\nThe agent’s value continues throughout the entire sales cycle. Five minutes before a discovery call, the rep can simply ask: _“Prep me for my call with Acme Corp.”_\n\nInstantly, the agent delivers an up-to-the-minute briefing document directly to the rep. It includes the latest company news, bios on the key contacts they’re meeting with, a [summary of previous interactions](https://writer.com/agents/client-relationship-history-summary/) from your CRM, and potential talking points aligned with your MEDDPICC framework. This powerful agentic automation eliminates the frantic, last-minute scramble for information and ensures every single seller walks into every meeting prepared, confident, and ready to win.\n\nHow WRITER delivers intelligent, agentic workflow automation\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDiscovering [WRITER](https://writer.com/) was a pivotal moment. I immediately recognized the platform I had been trying to build in my head for years — a cohesive system to replace the patchwork of tools I’d been using. It delivers true end-to-end workflow automation through a [full-stack architecture](https://writer.com/blog/what-is-full-stack-generative-ai/), fundamentally changing the speed of execution. This is possible because of a few key technological differentiators.\n\n### By analyzing accounts against your unique business criteria\n\nThrough [AI HQ](https://writer.com/blog/writer-ai-hq/), the agent begins by deeply understanding the nuances of your business. This allows it to connect directly to your company’s single source of truth — be it a data warehouse like Snowflake or a CRM like Salesforce. From there, it reasons over your proprietary data to find best-fit targets instead of just analyzing generic firmographics. This creates a secure, graph-based knowledge layer that understands the unique relationships within your business, ensuring the entire workflow focuses on the accounts most likely to convert.\n\n### By operating with enterprise-grade, zero-retention security\n\nThe entire process is governed by a commitment to [enterprise-grade security](https://writer.com/trust/). The analysis is a living process, not a static snapshot. It accomplishes this with a secure architecture that has achieved [SOC 2 Type II compliance](https://writer.com/blog/writer-iso-trust-center/) and handles standards like GDPR and HIPAA. WRITER’s platform, including its LLMs, is self-hosted and does not retain customer [data for training](https://writer.com/blog/llm-training-data/), ensuring your proprietary information remains yours alone. It connects to your systems while respecting all existing data permissions and [governance](https://writer.com/guides/generative-ai-governance/), providing a full audit trail for every action performed by the agent.\n\n### By using a purpose-built, GTM-native LLM\n\nThe agent generates customized outreach and talking points that sound authentic to your brand because it uses Palmyra, WRITER’s own family of transparent LLMs. These models, including our latest [Palmyra X5](https://writer.com/engineering/long-context-palmyra-x5/), are specifically fine-tuned using the language of go-to-market teams. With capabilities like a massive one-million-token context window, the agent can process an entire territory plan, multiple research documents, and long email chains in a single pass. This enables it to generate highly contextual, accurate, and fluent output that sounds like it came from your best seller, a feat impossible for generic AI tools.\n\nStop managing time and start maximizing impact\n----------------------------------------------\n\nLooking back, the shift was obvious. For years, we got stuck managing people’s time, meticulously tracking activities and hours. Now, we can focus on maximizing their impact.\n\nYou transform the financial health of your sales organization the moment you stop paying sellers to be administrators and empower them to be closers. The results are clear, measurable, and transformative:\n\n*   **Dramatically increased prospecting velocity**. Imagine your new reps actively engaging a prioritized list of high-potential accounts in their first week instead of their first quarter. The months-long ramp is compressed into a days-long sprint, driving immediate momentum.\n*   **Significant and measurable pipeline growth**. When every prospecting activity is strategic and targeted, the top of the funnel fills with higher-quality opportunities. This translates directly into a healthier, more predictable pipeline and alleviates the forecast anxiety that keeps leaders up at night.\n*   **Higher early-stage conversion rates**. Because every outreach is informed by deep research and tailored to a prospect’s specific needs, initial meetings are far more likely to convert into qualified opportunities. Reps are having meaningful business conversations from the very first touchpoint.\n\nThis is about more than just efficiency. It’s about giving your best people the leverage they deserve. It’s about building a sales engine that is disciplined, intelligent, and truly built to win in any market.\n\nThe era of the manual sales ramp is over. The future of sales is here and it’s powered by sales productivity AI agents.\n\nReady to see it for yourself?

It’s a strategic partner that can augment decision-making across every line of business.\n\nWhether users aim to reduce operational overhead or personalize customer experiences at scale, custom [AI agents](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/ai-agents/) are key.\n\nAs AI agents are adopted across enterprises, managing their deployment will require a deliberate strategy. The first steps are architecting the enterprise AI infrastructure to optimize for fast, cost-efficient inference and creating a data pipeline that keeps agents continuously fed with timely, contextual information.\n\nAlongside human and hardware resourcing, onboarding AI agents will become a core strategic function for businesses as leaders orchestrate digital talent across the organization.\n\nHere’s how to onboard teams of AI agents:\n\n## **1. Choose the Right AI Agent for the Task**\n\nJust as human employees are hired for specific roles, AI agents must be selected and trained based on the task they’re meant to perform. Enterprises now have access to a variety of AI models — including for language, vision, speech and reasoning — each with unique strengths.\n\nFor that reason, proper model selection is critical to achieving business outcomes:\n\n* Choose a [reasoning agent](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/reasoning-ai-agents-decision-making/#:~:text=Reasoning%20AI%20Agents%20in%20Action) to solve complex problems that require puzzling through answers.\n* Use a code-generation copilot to assist developers with writing, changing and merging code.\n* Deploy a [video analytics AI agent](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/video-analytics-ai-agents/) for analyzing site inspections or product defects.\n* Onboard a customer service [AI assistant](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/use-cases/ai-assistants/) that’s grounded in a specific knowledge base — rather than a generic [foundation model](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-are-foundation-models/).\n\nModel selection affects agent performance, costs, security and business alignment. The right model enables the agent to accurately address business challenges, align with compliance requirements and safeguard sensitive data. Choosing an unsuitable model can lead to overconsumption of computing resources, higher operational costs and inaccurate predictions that negatively impact agent decision-making.\n\nWith software like [NVIDIA NIM](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nim-microservices/) and [NeMo](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/) microservices, developers can swap in different models and connect tools based on their needs. The result: task-specific agents fine-tuned to meet a business’ goals, data strategy and compliance requirements.\n\n## **2. Upskill AI Agents by Connecting Them to Data**\n\nOnboarding AI agents requires building a strong data strategy.\n\nAI agents work best with a consistent stream of data that’s specific to the task and the business they’re operating within.\n\nInstitutional knowledge — the accumulated wisdom and experience within an organization — is a crucial asset that can often be lost when employees leave or retire. AI agents can play a pivotal role in capturing and preserving this knowledge for employees to use.\n\n* **Connecting AI to data sources**: To function at their best, AI agents must interpret a variety of data types, from structured databases to unstructured formats such as PDFs, images and videos. Such connection enables the agents to generate tailored, context-aware responses that go beyond the capabilities of a standalone foundation model, delivering more precise and valuable outcomes.\n* **AI as a knowledge repository**: AI agents benefit from systems that capture, process and reuse data. A [data flywheel](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-flywheel/) continuously collects, processes and uses information to iteratively improve the underlying system. AI systems benefit from [this flywheel](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/maximize-ai-agent-performance-with-data-flywheels-using-nvidia-nemo-microservices/), recording interactions, decisions and problem-solving approaches to self-optimize their model performance and efficiency. For example, integrating AI into customer service operations allows the system to learn from every conversation, capturing valuable feedback and questions. This data is then used to refine responses and maintain a comprehensive repository of institutional knowledge.\n\nNVIDIA NeMo supports the development of powerful data flywheels, providing the tools for continuously curating, refining and evaluating data and models. This enables AI agents to improve accuracy and optimize performance through ongoing adaptation and learning.\n\n## **3. Onboard AI Agents Into Lines of Business**\n\nOnce enterprises create the cloud-based, on-premises or hybrid AI infrastructure to support AI agents and refine the data strategy to feed those agents timely and contextual information, the next step is to systematically deploy AI agents across business units, moving from pilot to scale.\n\nAccording to a [recent IDC survey of 125 chief information officers](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=AP53248125&pageType=PRINTFRIENDLY), the top three areas that enterprises are looking to integrate agentic AI are IT processes, business operations and customer service.\n\nIn each area, AI agents help enhance the productivity of existing employees, such as by automating the ticketing process for IT engineers or giving employees easy access to data to help serve customers.\n\nAI agents in the enterprise could also be onboarded for:\n\nFor telecom operations, [Amdocs builds verticalized AI agents](https://www.amdocs.com/insights/whitepaper/ai-verticalization-for-telcos-defining-the-standard-for-telco-grade-agents-and-intelligent-autonomous-operations) using its amAIz platform to handle complex, multistep customer journeys — spanning sales, billing and care — and advance autonomous networks from optimized planning to efficient deployment. This helps ensure performance of the networks and the services they support.\n\nNVIDIA has partnered with various enterprises, [such as enterprise software company ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/nvidia-agentic-ai-partnership.html), and global systems integrators, like [Accenture](https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/2025/accenture-expands-ai-refinery-and-launches-new-industry-agent-solutions-to-accelerate-agentic-ai-adoption) and [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/about/press-room/deloitte-unveils-zora-ai-agentic-ai-for-tomorrows-workforce.html), to build and deploy AI agents for maximum business impact across use cases and lines of business.\n\n## **4. Provide Guardrails and Governance for AI Agents**\n\nJust like employees need clear guidelines to stay on track, AI models require well-defined guardrails to ensure they provide reliable, accurate outputs and operate within ethical boundaries.\n\n* [**Topical guardrails**](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemoguard-8b-topic-control): Topical guardrails prevent the AI from veering off into areas where they aren’t equipped to provide accurate answers. For instance, a customer service AI assistant should focus on resolving customer queries and not drift into unrelated topics such as upsells and offerings.\n* [**Content safety guardrails**](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemoguard-8b-content-safety): Content safety guardrails moderate human-[LLM](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/large-language-models/) interactions by classifying prompts and responses as safe or unsafe and tagging violations by category when unsafe. These guardrails filter out unwanted language and make sure references are made only to reliable sources, so the AI’s output is trustworthy.\n* [**Jailbreak** **guardrails**](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoguard-jailbreak-detect): With a growing number of agents having access to sensitive information, the agents could become vulnerable to data breaches over time. Jailbreak guardrails are designed to help with adversarial threats as well as detect and block jailbreak and prompt injection attempts targeting LLMs. These help ensure safer AI interactions by identifying malicious prompt manipulations in real time.\n\n[NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemo-guardrails) empower enterprises to set and enforce domain-specific guidelines by providing a flexible, programmable framework that keeps AI agents aligned with organizational policies, helping ensure they consistently operate within approved topics, maintain safety standards and comply with security requirements with the least latency added at inference.\n\n## **Get Started Onboarding AI Agents**\n\nThe best AI agents are not one-size-fits-all. They’re custom-trained, purpose-built and continuously learning.\n\nBusiness leaders can start their AI agent onboarding process by asking:\n\n* What business outcomes do we want AI to drive?\n* What knowledge and tools does the AI need access to?\n* Who are the human collaborators or overseers?\n\nIn the near future, every line of business will have dedicated AI agents — trained on its data, tuned to its goals and aligned with its compliance needs. The organizations that invest in thoughtful onboarding, secure data strategies and continuous learning are poised to lead the next phase of enterprise transformation.\n\n*Watch this* [*on-demand webinar*](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/events/supercharge-agentic-ai-build-scalable-data-flywheels/) *to learn how to create an automated data flywheel that continuously collects feedback to onboard, fine-tune and scale AI agents across enterprises.*\n\n*Stay up to date on agentic AI, NVIDIA Nemotron and more by subscribing to* [*NVIDIA AI news*](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/executive-insights/generative-ai-tools/?modal=stay-inf)*,* [*joining the community*](https://developer.nvidia.com/community) *and following NVIDIA AI on* [*LinkedIn*](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fshowcase%2Fnvidia-ai%2Fposts%2F%3FfeedView%3Dall)*,* [*Instagram*](https://www.instagram.com/nvidiaai/?hl=en)*,* [*X*](https://x.com/NVIDIAAIDev) *and* [*Facebook*](https://www.facebook.com/NVIDIAAI)*.**Explore the self-paced* [*video tutorials and livestreams*](http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5B692fm6--vdRKB14FImVi7MTJ77zjn4&feature=shared)*.*\n\n[Share This](https://x.com/intent/tweet?via=%username%&url=%url%&text=%prefix%%text%%suffix%&hashtags=%hashtags%)\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%url%&t=%title%)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?mini=true&url=%url%&title=%title%)\n\n### Share on Mastodon\n\nShare this Article\n\nEmail sent!\n\n "

introduces a unified AI platform designed to connect workflows, data and employees across enterprise environments.\n\n**In Brief**\n\n* Gemini Enterprise consolidates Google’s AI models, infrastructure and productivity tools under one system for connected workplace intelligence.\n* The platform links Workspace, Salesforce, SAP and other business systems, combining no-code automation, custom agents and centralized governance.\n* Gemini Enterprise signals Google’s broader move from isolated AI features to an orchestrated, enterprise-scale AI operating layer.\n\nGoogle launched Gemini Enterprise today, a platform designed to unify the company’s AI models, data infrastructure and productivity tools under a single enterprise-grade system. Framed by the company as a “[new front door](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/introducing-gemini-enterprise \"new front door\")” for workplace AI, Gemini Enterprise centralizes access through connections to Google Workspace and other major enterprise systems, and layers in governance, automation and no-code agent creation.\n\nIn practical terms, the platform is meant to orchestrate work across teams and apps: instead of isolated copilots or chatbots, Gemini Enterprise aims to coordinate multi-step tasks that draw on enterprise data and take actions across connected systems.\n\n## Gemini Enterprise: Orchestrated AI, Not Just Another Assistant\n\nOver the past year, Google’s AI story has moved from model demos to operational integration. Its progression — first, [strengthening the Gemini models](https://www.reworked.co/digital-workplace/googles-gemini-20-pro-can-shake-up-the-workplace-heres-how/ \"strengthening the Gemini models\"); next, [weaving AI into Workspace](https://www.reworked.co/digital-workplace/google-preps-gemini-20-and-folds-ai-into-new-workspace-pricing/ \"weaving AI into Workspace\"); and now, consolidating everything behind an orchestration layer built for enterprise workflows — is a logical progression following the company's [increased attention to Google Workspace](https://www.reworked.co/collaboration-productivity/google-workspace-is-coming-for-slack-and-microsoft-teams/ \"increased attention to Google Workspace\") in the last year and a half.\n\nCritically, the company opted for an open ecosystem approach, which provides Gemini Enterprise customers the choice of building workflows with any of the 100,000 partners in its agentic AI ecosystem.\n\nThe logic behind this sequence is clear: Stronger models enable richer reasoning over long, messy business contexts. Embedding AI throughout Workspace increases familiarity with the assistive features and builds habits. The enterprise platform then ties these strands together with the underlying governance levers that organizations need: identity, security, data access, auditability and policy controls.\n\n## No-Code Agent Workbench and Further Google Workspace Integration\n\nAs part of the rollout, Google also unveiled deeper integration into Google Workspace, bringing multi-modal agents into Vids and Meet. In Meet, Gemini can now provide real-time translation that matches the speaker's tone and inflection. Google Vids can now generate a video, complete with voiceover, from a static document or slide deck.\n\nAlongside these Workspace integrations, Gemini Enterprise introduces a no-code agent workbench that lets business users build and deploy their own AI agents without writing code. Through a guided interface, teams can design agents that connect to company data, trigger actions across major business systems, while still following enterprise governance rules.\n\nWhen combined with Google's growing library of prebuilt agents — including recent additions for deep research and data insights — employees can make the leap from simple requests to full process automation.\n\n## The 6 Components Gemini Enterprise Unites\n\nThe platform consolidates six core components through a single conversational interface.\n\n| Capability | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gemini Models | AI models for reasoning and intelligence |\n| No-code workbench | Tools for data analysis and workflow automation |\n| Agent library | Pre-built and custom agents for specific tasks |\n| Data integration | Connections to Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, SAP |\n| Centralized governance | Management of security, visibility and auditing |\n| Partner ecosystem | 100,000+ partners for flexibility and innovation |\n\n## Google and Microsoft, Off to the Races Once More\n\nGoogle’s Gemini Enterprise intensifies the head-to-head contest with Microsoft by combining AI models, workflow orchestration and productivity tools into a unified stack. Microsoft's Copilot Studio added multi-agent orchestration in May, enabling agents to hand off tasks, collaborate across domains and coordinate complex workflows.\n\nIn the new phase of enterprise AI, the race isn’t about who has the smartest assistant — it’s about who controls the orchestration layer that runs the enterprise. Google and Microsoft aren't alone here. [Salesforce and ServiceNow](https://www.reworked.co/digital-workplace/servicenow-and-salesforce-fight-to-be-the-center-of-ai-agent-operations/ \"see Salesforce and ServiceNow\") are also racing to build their own orchestration layers as well. But with Gemini Enterprise, Google is betting that openness, not vendor lock-in, will win that race.\n\n*Have a tip to share with our editorial team?

Today it launched [Gemini Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise?ref=maginative.com), a subscription platform that pulls chat, enterprise search, and AI agents into a single interface—and plugs them into the systems you already use.\n\n### Key Points\n\n* $30/user/mo for Enterprise; $21 for Business.\n* Prebuilt agents plus a no-code workbench; central governance and security.\n* Works with Google Workspace and third-party stacks like Microsoft 365, Salesforce, SAP.\n* Early customers include Gap, Figma, Klarna.\n\nAt its “Gemini at Work” event, Google positioned [Gemini Enterprise](https://cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise?ref=maginative.com) as the new entry point for AI at work: a chat UI that can search across company systems, call tools, and orchestrate agents—Google’s and yours. The idea is less “ask a bot a question,” more “delegate a workflow.”\n\nUnder the hood, Google is leaning on its latest Gemini models and packaging prebuilt agents (for deep research, data analysis, code, and customer engagement) alongside a no-code/low-code workbench to build and chain custom agents. There’s also a central governance layer for security, audit, and policy—an area buyers increasingly scrutinize as agent deployments scale.\n\nPricing lands about where many CIOs expect: $30 per user per month for Gemini Enterprise (Standard/Plus editions) and $21for Gemini Business, a lighter tier aimed at departments and SMBs. That puts Google in the same budget conversation as Microsoft’s Copilot SKUs and OpenAI’s enterprise offerings.\n\nCrucially, Google isn’t trying to wall you into Workspace. Gemini Enterprise integrates with Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and SAP, in addition to Google’s own stack—important for mixed estates. Early adopters include Gap, Figma, and Klarna, signaling traction beyond tech.\n\nThere’s a clear agents-first posture. Google says the platform replaces last year’s Agentspace app and adds a visual Agent Designer. New and upcoming vertical agents—like Data Science Agent and an upgraded Customer Engagement Suite—aim to shrink time-to-value. In practice, that means less wiring, more “spin up an agent, connect data, measure outcomes.”\n\nGoogle is also pushing open protocols for the emerging “agent economy.” Its Agent2Agent (A2A) targets cross-vendor agent interoperability, while the Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) (developed with payments partners) sketches a way for agents to transact with auditable proofs. If these standards stick, buyers get portability and fewer bespoke integrations.\n\nWhy now? The enterprise AI race is heating up on all fronts. Microsoft continues to ship Copilot across 365 apps, and OpenAI is adding business solutions inside ChatGPT. Google’s play is to centralize: one place to discover, build, govern, and run agents grounded in company data—plus the ecosystem to match. Meanwhile, Google Cloud’s scale (now a >$50B annual run-rate) gives it resources to battle for the desktop.\n\nOne more telling signal: Figma expanded its partnership with Google today to bring Gemini models like 2.5 Flash into design workflows—evidence that Google’s enterprise pitch extends well beyond back-office automation into daily creative tooling.\n\nThe subtext is simple: the AI platform you choose will shape how your teams search, decide, and ship. Google’s bet is that giving you the platform, not just the models, is the lever that moves real work.\n\nChris McKay is the founder and chief editor of Maginative.

Here’s 10 new products every partner and customer needs to know about.*\n\nshare  \nthis\n\nFrom its new [Gemini Enterprise agentic platform](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/google-cloud-ceo-on-new-gemini-enterprise-bringing-ai-to-everyone \"Gemini Enterprise agentic platform\") to new training programs like Google Skills, the tech giant unleashed a slew of new products, programs and innovation to win mindshare in the AI era.\n\n“What we’re doing is bringing AI to everyone by providing them a single front door through which they can chat with all of their enterprise data, search for information and use agents to do a variety of tasks on their behalf,” said Google Cloud CEO Kurian regarding the launch of Gemini Enterprise.\n\nThe Mountain View, Calif.-based technology giant launched new innovation for Workspace’s Vids and Meet products, a new AI Agent Finder tool that helps businesses discover and procure [AI agents](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/10-hottest-agentic-ai-tools-and-agents-of-2025-so-far \"AI agents\"), provided the price tags for Gemini Enterprise customers, and unveiled its new Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR) program, to name a few.\n\nCRN breaks down the 10 biggest [new Google products](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/google-cloud-s-6-new-ai-agents-and-gemini-innovations-key-features \"new Google products\"), programs and tools launched this month by the AI innovator that every customer, developer and channel partner needs to know about.\n\n**[Related: [Google Invests $4B In New U.S. Data Center To Fuel AI’s ‘Next Generation,’ President Says](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/google-invests-4b-in-new-u-s-data-center-to-fuel-ai-s-next-generation-president-says \"Google Invests $4B In New U.S. Data Center To Fuel AI’s ‘Next Generation,’ President Says\")]**\n\n**Google Gemini Enterprise**\n\nGoogle’s new Gemini Enterprise brings together several [AI technologies](https://www.crn.com/news/security/2025/google-debuts-new-ransomware-protection-5-things-to-know \"AI technologies\") including Google’s Gemini models, first and third-party AI agents, and core conversational AI and orchestration innovation from Google Agentspace.\n\nGemini Enterprise includes a no-code workbench so any user can analyze information and orchestrate agents to automate processes across an organization. Combined with Google DeepMind’s models and customers’ own corporate data, agents can access and synthesize information from internal systems as well as Google AI tools like Code Assist and Deep Research within a single enterprise workflow.\n\nGemini Enterprise securely connects to customers’ data wherever it lives, including [Google Workspace](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2025/google-cloud-president-on-fastest-growing-cloud-marketplace-success \"Google Workspace\"), [Microsoft 365](https://www.crn.com/news/ai/2025/microsoft-marketplace-promises-simpler-ai-agent-purchasing-experience \"Microsoft 365\") and Microsoft SharePoint to business applications like Salesforce and SAP.\n\nWith built-in security and governance, the platform enforces granular access permissions—ensuring agents can only use data and take actions that individuals are authorized for— protections like Model Armor are now built-in to the Gemini Enterprise platform.\n\n“Gemini Enterprise is integrating all of [our agentic AI] pieces into a super easy-to-use platform for every user, in every company—no matter how small or how large—and teams and departments within these companies to use AI at scale,” Kurian said.\n\n*Click through to read about the other nine new products, programs and news released from Google this month.*\n\n**New Google Vids And Google Meet Features**\n\nGoogle launched new features inside Workspace’s Vids and Meet to help enhance its AI capabilities.\n\nWith Google Vids, users can now transform one type of information, like a presentation, into a completely different format—an engaging video with an AI-generated script and voiceover.\n\nGoogle said Vids now has 2.5 million people using it every month.\n\nIn Google Meet, users now have real-time speech translation to all business customers. Google said it goes beyond just words, capturing users’ natural tone and expressions to make conversations seamless, no matter what language.\n\n**AI Agent Finder For Customers**\n\nGoogle customers now have access to a new AI Agent Finder that helps businesses discover and procure AI agents and services from channel partners and independent software vendors (ISVs).\n\n“Customers can search for agents from trusted vendors and filter by industry, use case, and whether they have been validated for A2A and deployment to Gemini Enterprise,” said Kevin Ichhpurani, president of the global partner organization at Google Cloud, in a blog post.\n\nThe new AI Agent Finder helps clients find, filter and deploy AI agents that have been previously reviewed for security and interoperability.\n\n“These agents can then be purchased from Google Cloud Marketplace or directly through partners, and immediately deployed into their environments,” he said.\n\nGoogle said its comprehensive agentic AI ecosystem, consisting of more than 100,000 partners, can support every layer of a customers’ AI stack–from AI infrastructure to various AI services provided by channel partners.\n\n**New Data Science Agent**\n\nAs part of Gemini Enterprise, Google announced a new data science agent.\n\nThis new data science agent can automate data wrangling and ingestion.\n\nIt accelerates detailed data exploration, instantly finding patterns and streamlines complex model development by generating multi-step plans for training and inferencing. This eliminates the need for manual, iterative fine-tuning.\n\nGoogle said enterprise customers like Vodafone and Walmart are already using the new data science agent to accelerate their data workflows and remove friction from the customer experience.\n\n**Google Skills Platform**\n\nGoogle Skills is a new platform where training from across Google—from Gemini Enterprise to Google Deepmind—is now available for free.\n\nGoogle Skills brings together 3,000 courses and labs in one place — including content from across Google Cloud, Google DeepMind, Grow with Google, and Google for Education.\n\nThis new learning platform is designed to help partners and people develop the skills they need to be successful and to enable businesses to find and develop the talent they need to thrive.\n\n**Google Cloud’s Agentspace Becomes Part Of Gemini Enterprise As ‘The Workbench’**\n\nOne of the key pieces of information Google wants partners and customers to know about is that Agentspace is no more.\n\nGoogle said Agentspace was the vision for an agent-driven enterprise, focused on the powerful technology for building and orchestrating agents. Kurian said Gemini Enterprise is the full realization of that vision and much more.\n\nThe agent creation and orchestration technology pioneered with Agentspace is now a core, integrated component of Gemini Enterprise, that Google calls ‘The Workbench.’\n\n**Gemini Enterprise Prices**\n\nGemini Enterprise Standard and Plus editions annual plans start at $30 per seat per month.\n\nGemini Business annual plans start at $21 per seat per month. Business Edition includes a 30-day free trial period for all customers.\n\n“Gemini Enterprise is the front door, and we’re democratizing how people can access AI and bring the power of enterprise chat, connectivity to enterprise sources, prepackaged agents and search, to every user and every company,” said Kurian.\n\n**New Agentic AI Technologies For Conversational AI**\n\nAs part of Google’s Customer Engagement Suite, which focuses on conversational AI solutions for web, mobile apps, call centers and point of sale, Google unveiled several new features.\n\nThis includes a new low-code visual builder where users can build a customer engagement agent once, and configure it for all your channels — telephony, web, mobile, email, and chat.\n\nAdditionally, Google will provide new AI augmentation services and prebuilt specialized agents to allow agents builders to build, test, deploy and monitor agents faster. In addition, Google also uses AI assisted coaching to increase employee productivity.\n\n**GEAR Program**\n\nGoogle built a new Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR) program.\n\nThe new educational GEAR program is designed to empower one million developers to build and deploy agents on Google’s new agentic platform, Gemini Enterprise.\n\nGoogle aims to help customers of all shapes and sizes build, deploy and manage agents.

Here’s what to watch for next.\n\n### Transcript\n\nIT’S BEEN NEARLY THREE YEARS since artificial intelligence (AI) appeared on the scene. In that time, its promise has grown every quarter across seemingly every sector of the economy. Yet, despite Big Tech’s capital mobilization — over $300 billion[1](#footnote-1 \"footnote 1\") in planned spending in 2025 alone — those companies have yet to see a return on their investments. “We haven’t even scratched the surface about how much money is needed,” says Haim Israel, head of Global Thematic Investing for BofA Global Research.\n\nIn the video above, Israel talks with Chris Hyzy, Chief Investment Officer, Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, about setbacks and risks that could slow the trajectory of the AI buildout, as well as the long-term potential for AI to transform everything about how we live and work. They delve into the race between the U.S. and China for AI dominance and identify potential long-term investment opportunities — from commodities such as copper, nickel and silicon to sectors including energy and transportation. And they answer the question top of mind for many investors: How should we think about AI as this tech revolution accelerates? Says Israel, “We are seeing rates that we’ve never seen in the past. This is now spreading to every industry in warp speed.”\n\nFor latest insights on the markets, tune in regularly to the CIO's [Market Update audiocast series](/articles/daily-market-insights-recent.html).\n\n## Choose your advisor in a more personalized way\n\nAll our advisors are committed to putting your needs and priorities first.

However, even with AI-related savings, the world is still $800 billion short to keep pace with demand, new research by Bain & Company finds.\n\nBain’s [sixth annual Global Technology Report](/insights/topics/technology-report/) released today shows, by 2030, global incremental AI compute requirements could reach 200 gigawatts, with the US accounting for half of the power. Even if companies in the US shifted all of their on-premise IT budgets to cloud and reinvested the savings from applying AI in sales, marketing, customer support, and R&D into capital spending on new data centers, the amount would still fall short of the revenue needed to fund the full investment, as AI’s compute demand grows at more than twice the rate of Moore’s Law, Bain notes.\n\n“If the current scaling laws hold, AI will increasingly strain supply chains globally,” said [David Crawford](/our-team/david-crawford/), chairman of [Bain’s Global Technology Practice](/industry-expertise/technology/). “By 2030, technology executives will be faced with the challenge of deploying about $500 billion in capital expenditures and finding about $2 trillion in new revenue to profitably meet demand. Meanwhile, because AI compute demand is outpacing semiconductor efficiency, the trends call for dramatic increases in power supply on grids that have not added capacity for decades. Add the arms race dynamic between nations and leading providers, and the potential for overbuild and underbuild has never been more challenging to navigate. Working through the potential for innovation, infrastructure, supply shortages, and algorithmic gains is critical to navigate the next few years.”\n\n**Agentic AI develops at breakneck speed; could offer another round of gains**\n\nWhile computational demand increases, leading companies have moved from piloting AI capabilities to profiting from AI as organizations scale the technology across core workflows delivering 10% to 25% earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) gains over the last two years. Yet most companies today remain stuck in AI experimentation mode and are satisfied with modest productivity gains, the report concludes.\n\nTech-forward enterprises are pursuing agentic AI capabilities which is making for an unprecedented rate of innovation, the report finds. Over the next three to five years, 5% to 10% of technology spending could be directed toward building foundational AI capabilities including agent platforms, communication protocols, real-time data access and discoverability for agents. As much as half of overall technology spending by companies could be used on AI agents running across the enterprise, Bain estimates.\n\nAs AI evolves, the report shows leaders will pull further ahead of laggards in four levels of maturity including (1) large language model (LLM)-powered information retrieval agents, (2) single-task agentic workflows, (3) cross-system agentic workflow orchestration, and (4) multi-agent constellations. Levels 2 and 3 are where capital, innovation, and deployment velocity are converging. With AI innovation moving at breakneck speed, leaders are compounding their advantage while followers are getting further behind.\n\nMeanwhile, enterprise IT architectures are struggling to realize the vision of contextually-informed secure agents freely collaborating across multiple applications and databases to automate the diverse tasks accomplished by humans. Bain finds that a north star architecture is critical, but profit motives and security demands will lead to uneven progress toward the four levels of agentic maturity over years.\n\n**AI is disrupting SaaS, but whether it disrupts a SaaS provider is up to them**\n\nSaaS providers are facing disruption from the rise of generative and agentic AI, but this does not mean obsolescence.  In many cases this can be total addressable market (TAM)-additive for SaaS providers. Companies should evaluate two independent characteristics as they plan to benefit from AI in their industry: the potential for AI to (1) automate SaaS user tasks and (2) penetrate SaaS workflows. SaaS incumbents are well-positioned to lead, but this will require high-stakes strategic bets—such as selective open-sourcing or a shift in the monetization model—and will yield a unique, durable industry influence position. To stay ahead, providers must own the data, lead on standards, and price for outcomes, not log-ons, in an AI-first world.\n\n**New norm for business leaders as sovereign AI creates a fragmented world**\n\nTariffs, export controls, and the push by governments worldwide for sovereign AI are accelerating the fragmentation of global technology supply chains, Bain finds. Cutting-edge domains such as AI are no longer just catalysts for economic growth but are conduits for countries’ political power and national security. As semiconductor supply chains fragment, the US and China remain at the forefront of the decoupling movement, with China accounting for roughly 20% of global chip manufacturing capacity just this year, the report shows.\n\n“Sovereign AI capabilities are increasingly seen as a strategic advantage on par with economic and military strength,” said [Anne Hoecker](/our-team/anne-hoecker/), head of Bain’s Global Technology practice. “While sovereign AI is a global priority, individual countries’ goals vary. Therefore, for most countries, achieving full-stack independence is not feasible, at least not today. Considering these differences, global AI standards are unlikely to converge.\n\n“To succeed, multinational firms will need to localize not just compliance, but also their technology architecture. Businesses need to make decisions with optionality, moving boldly where confidence is high and prioritizing flexibility where uncertainty rules.”\n\n**Companies eye quantum computing advancements, rise of humanoid robots**\n\nAlongside rapid acceleration of AI initiatives are two separate technological phenomena: the advancement of quantum computing, and the rise of humanoid robots.\n\nQuantum computing has the potential to unlock as much as $250 billion in market value across industries such as pharmaceuticals, finance, logistics, and materials science, posing opportunities that will be gradual— though not guaranteed, Bain estimates. While the potential posed by quantum computing is immense, to reach full market potential, a fully capable and fault-tolerant computer will be needed at scale and is still years away, the report concludes.\n\nIn parallel, interest in humanoid robots has increased from viral videos to billion-dollar valuations. As humanoid robots become more prevalent, commercial success will hinge on ecosystem readiness, and companies that pilot them early will be best positioned to become the leaders during a new era of growth. While robots draw both headlines and capital, most deployments remain early-stage with heavy reliance on human supervision, Bain finds.\n\n**Technology private equity deals slow in second half of 2025, though temperament remains upbeat**\n\nGone are the days of easy technology private equity (PE) deals as deal momentum fueled by software sales slows. According to Bain’s 2025 analysis of PE technology deals in North America, deal-making has not been immune to tariff-related uncertainties and geopolitical tensions despite an increase in tech deals in the first half of this year. While software spending continues to outpace overall GDP growth, software’s penetration is topping out across major sectors, such as manufacturing and retail, posing new challenges for tech investors who will need to work harder to find new sources of top-tier growth. Despite deal process slowdowns, investors remain upbeat as Technology has outperformed most other sectors in terms of dealmaking, Bain’s analysis shows.\n\n**Media contacts**\n\n*To arrange an interview or for any questions, please contact:*\n\nDan Pinkney (Boston) — Email: [dan.pinkney@bain.com](mailto:dan.pinkney@bain.com)\n\nAmanda Folsom (Boston) — Email: [amanda.folsom@bain.com](mailto:amanda.folsom@bain.com)\n\nGary Duncan (London) — Email: [gary.duncan@bain.com](mailto:gary.duncan@bain.com)\n\nAnn Lee (Singapore) — Email: [ann.lee@bain.com](mailto:ann.lee@bain.com)\n\n**About Bain & Company**\n\nBain & Company is a global consultancy that helps the world’s most ambitious change makers define the future.\n\nAcross 65 cities in 40 countries, we work alongside our clients as one team with a shared ambition to achieve extraordinary results, outperform the competition, and redefine industries.

              "raw_content": "# The Investment Themes That Are Outperforming AI\n\nSuccessful thematic investing is about more than just following growth trends.\n\n[Dan Lefkovitz](/people/dan-lefkovitz)\n\nSecurities in This Article\n\n[NVIDIA Corp\n\n(NVDA)](/stocks/xnas/nvda/quote)\n\nSometimes, when people find out my work relates to markets, they’ll bring up an exciting investment trend. Artificial intelligence is by far the most popular topic of conversation right now. Renewable energy used to come up more. Cannabis also had a day in the sun (or hydroponic lamp).\n\nI always squirm a bit when I hear about investing based on themes. Earlier this year, I [wrote about](https://www.morningstar.com/markets/are-stock-investors-another-tech-wreck) getting burned buying Internet stocks 25 years ago. As a theme, the Internet was perfectly valid; it changed the way we all live and work. But the 1990s market got way too far ahead of itself. Internet business models took years to develop. Then prices reflected highly unrealistic growth expectations.\n\nNo doubt, it’s an extreme example. Yet, it reflects the pitfalls of thematic equity investing that my colleague [Dan Sotiroff](https://www.morningstar.com/people/daniel-sotiroff) described in a terrific article called [Don’t Fall for a Good Story](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/dont-fall-good-story). Dan sees thematic investors as making a trifecta bet: First, that the theme will pan out; second, that chosen investments will benefit; and third, that stock prices will rise. Themes are typically widely appreciated. Perceived beneficiaries tend to be high-priced.\n\nLast year, Morningstar launched 15 [Thematic Consensus Indexes](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-artificial-intelligence-big-data-consensus-FS0000ITMP?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview), which include the stocks most commonly held by mutual funds and ETFs focused on specific themes. Their behavior and composition highlight the challenges thematic investors face.\n\n## Picking Winning Themes Is Hard\n\nMy first takeaway from the exhibit is that it’s difficult to beat the market. Seven of the themes outperformed the broad global equities universe over the past five years; seven underperformed. (Thematic consensus indexes’ prelaunch returns were simulated based on historical fund holdings data. [Nano Technology & New Materials](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-nano-technology-new-materials-consensus-FS0000ITJN?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview)‘ history was insufficient.)\n\nAt a glance, all the themes look like legitimate growth trends. Who doesn’t like food—especially as diets in the developing world change? The global energy transition, the healthcare needs of an aging demographic, and the spread of digital payments and cryptocurrencies will all be familiar to readers. The technology trends captured by the indexes all seem inexorable.\n\nI’m not surprised to see that the best-performing themes in recent years are tech-focused, given that sector’s market leadership. But the fact that two themes outperformed the [Morningstar Global Artificial Intelligence + Big Data Consensus Index](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-artificial-intelligence-big-data-consensus-FS0000ITMP) over the past five years was eyebrow-raising.\n\nI wouldn’t say the two top performers, [Future Mobility](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-future-mobility-consensus-FS0000ITMX) and [Robotics & Automation](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-robotics-automation-consensus-FS0000ITMZ?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview), have been more successful than AI as themes. AI is attracting trillions in corporate spending, even as questions remain about its impact. When I look at those two thematic indexes, I notice both have devoted more weight to Nvidia [NVDA](/stocks/xnas/nvda/quote), whose gain of more than 1,200% over the past five years is a key driver of relative returns. Nvidia’s technology enables autonomous vehicles and robots, as well as AI.\n\nOn the other end of the performance spectrum, the healthcare sector has been a serious laggard in recent years, which explains poor returns from [Wellness](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-wellness-consensus-FS0000ITN0?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview) and [Life Sciences](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-life-sciences-consensus-FS0000ITMT?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview). [Policy concerns](https://www.morningstar.com/markets/healthcare-stocks-got-left-behind-market-rally-are-they-buy) are a big part of the story. The sector has been weighed down by expectations of downward pressure on pricing. While that has opened up company-specific investment opportunities, according to my colleagues on Morningstar Equity Research, it has made for a disappointing recent investment experience.\n\nWhy has [Battery Technology](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-battery-technology-consensus-FS0000ITNC?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview) been such a dud? Isn’t energy storage crucial to decarbonization, electric vehicles, and all manner of devices? Yes, but the index contains a bunch of [lithium producers](https://www.morningstar.com/company-reports/1244030-lithium-we-expect-a-recovery-in-2025) who have been hit by a price collapse thanks to oversupply. [Investing in commodities is not for the faint of heart](https://www.morningstar.com/markets/why-natural-resources-may-be-worth-look-today).\n\n## Do Themes Add to a Portfolio?\n\nThematic investors might ask themselves whether they are not already sufficiently exposed through other portfolio holdings. The tech sector already exceeds 25% of global equities market value; in the US, tech stocks represent one-third of the market. Many of the thematic consensus indexes are heavy on technology, and because they are market-capitalization-weighted, they include generous helpings of mega-caps like Nvidia.\n\nGiven holdings overlap, correlations are unsurprisingly high between some of the thematic indexes and the broad global equities universe (the first index listed in the matrix below.)\n\nYou’ll see that the healthcare-focused themes have lower correlations. That’s not surprising given the underperformance of the healthcare sector and its falling share of the global equities market. I was surprised to see the cybersecurity index with a relatively low correlation to the broad equity market, though.\n\n## Lessons for Thematic Investors\n\nMixed performance for thematic indexes is telling. Bets against the broad stock market are hard to get right. That’s evident in the [woeful performance of most active managers](https://www.morningstar.com/business/insights/research/active-passive-barometer?gad_campaignid=20564722940&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACr_AGkPrW33CgjgKeC5SStcbVTGR&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0NPGBhCDARIsAGAzpp1Vt3iWX7rHR47UBVlZ0jUmyTVNrMlL0bfCZ3x5554hnod6xcejBsYaApcGEALw_wcB&utm_campaign=res_na_usa_us_en_2309_tf_nb_n_rgsnbactivepassivebrmtrus&utm_content=engine:google|campaignid:20564722940|adid:764740746878&utm_id=n&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&utm_term=morningstar+active+passive). It also goes for systematic approaches, like those based on [investment factors](https://www.morningstar.com/personal-finance/paying-attention-investment-factors-you-should-be).\n\nMeanwhile, high correlations between many themes and the broad market should prompt questions about whether separate thematic investments are superfluous. Growth trends like AI explain much of the market’s recent gains. Most of the largest stocks are thematic beneficiaries. It’s also the case that many of the companies on the leading edge of themes are private. That goes for [SpaceX](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/46488-07), [OpenAI](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/149504-14), and [Stripe](https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/54782-29/company/profile), a fintech.\n\nContrarian investors, for their part, might be drawn to underperformers and less-correlated themes. Perhaps the coming years will see a recovery for themes like [Life Sciences](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-life-sciences-consensus-FS0000ITMT?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview) and [Wellness](https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-global-wellness-consensus-FS0000ITN0?currency=USD&variant=TR&tab=overview), or those that include lots of basic materials stocks. The diversification they provide will be especially appreciated if AI, like the internet and many prior growth trends, leads to a bubble, then a crash.\n\nThe author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

          "output": "## AI Agents for Productivity\n\nAI agents are emerging as a transformative technology for small businesses seeking to enhance productivity beyond simple automation tools. Unlike chatbots or single-task copilots, AI agents are autonomous systems capable of understanding natural language commands and executing complex, multi-step workflows from start to finish [1]. They connect seamlessly with existing systems, adhering to data permissions and governance, and provide a full audit trail for every action, ensuring transparency and control [1].\n\nThe impact of AI agents spans various business functions, fundamentally altering how teams operate. In sales, for instance, AI agents address the significant challenge of inefficient prospecting, where up to 77% of a salesperson's time can be spent on administrative tasks rather than selling [1]. By automating the entire prospecting workflow, these agents can build territory plans based on Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs), perform deep account research from sources like 10-Ks and LinkedIn profiles, generate personalized outreach emails, and even provide instant call preparation with up-to-the-minute briefings [1]. This not only dramatically increases prospecting velocity and pipeline growth but also frees sales professionals to act as strategic advisors, focusing on relationship building and nuanced problem-solving [1].\n\nBeyond sales, AI agents are proving invaluable across other departments. In Human Resources, they can optimize processes from hiring to retirement, enhancing employee experience and boosting efficiency for HR leaders, recruiters, managers, and employees [3]. Examples include:\n*   **Internal Mobility & Recruiting:** Agents can match employees with career opportunities, assess job fit, and automate interview scheduling, managing calendars and resolving conflicts [3].\n*   **Career Development & Skills:** Agents can summarize performance for 1:1 check-ins, assist managers in setting and tracking team goals, provide learning support, and advise on promotions and career development [3].\n*   **Core HR:** Employee and Manager Concierge agents can quickly answer inquiries regarding compensation, benefits, leave, or talent management, while Positions Assistant agents aid in informed staffing decisions [3].\n\nFor general individual productivity, AI agents can also be custom-built to streamline daily tasks, such as checking calendars, summarizing meetings, and drafting follow-up emails automatically [2]. This broad applicability, evidenced by some companies running 55 AI agents to manage their operations, highlights the scalability of these tools for small businesses [4].\n\nTo successfully implement AI agents, a strong data strategy is crucial. Agents perform best when continuously fed with data specific to the business and the tasks they undertake, effectively capturing and preserving institutional knowledge [5]. Furthermore, establishing clear guardrails and governance is vital to ensure agents deliver reliable, accurate, and ethical outputs. This includes implementing topical guardrails to keep agents focused, content safety guardrails to moderate language, and jailbreak guardrails to protect against malicious prompts [5]. Many solutions offer enterprise-grade security, including SOC 2 Type II compliance and adherence to GDPR and HIPAA standards, ensuring proprietary data remains secure and is not used for agent training [1].\n\nThe future points to a landscape where every line of business will have dedicated AI agents, custom-trained to specific goals and compliance needs, driving unprecedented levels of productivity and strategic impact [5].\n\n---\n### Sources\n[1] How sales productivity AI agents fix broken prospecting — Writer — [https://writer.com/blog/sales-productivity-ai-agent/](https://writer.com/blog/sales-productivity-ai-agent/)\n[2] Is anyone using any type of AI agent to improve productivity? — Reddit — [https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1o22u1h/is_anyone_using_any_type_of_ai_agent_to_improve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1o22u1h/is_anyone_using_any_type_of_ai_agent_to_improve/)\n[3] Oracle AI Agents Help HR Leaders Boost Workforce Productivity and Enhance Performance Management — Oracle — [https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-ai-agents-help-hr-leaders-boost-workforce-productivity-and-enhance-performance-management-2025-09-16/](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-ai-agents-help-hr-leaders-boost-workforce-productivity-and-enhance-performance-management-2025-09-16/)\n[4] How to Build AI Agents to 10x your PM Productivity with CEO of... — news.aakashg.com — [https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/jacob-bank-podcast](https://www.news.aakashg.com/p/jacob-bank-podcast)\n[5] AI On: How Onboarding Teams of AI Agents Drives Productivity and... — blogs.nvidia.com — [https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/onboarding-teams-ai-agents-productivity-revenue-businesses/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/onboarding-teams-ai-agents-productivity-revenue-businesses/)"

          "output": "## Google's Unified AI Tools\n\nGoogle has introduced Gemini Enterprise, a significant new platform designed to unify its artificial intelligence (AI) models, data infrastructure, and productivity tools under a single, enterprise-grade system [1, 3]. Positioned as a \"new front door\" for AI in the workplace, this platform aims to move businesses beyond fragmented AI features toward a cohesive, orchestrated AI layer that streamlines operations across the entire organization [1, 2, 5].\n\nFor small-business leaders, Gemini Enterprise represents a powerful shift from isolated AI assistants to comprehensive workflow delegation. Instead of merely asking a chatbot questions, the platform enables the orchestration of multi-step tasks that leverage company data and trigger actions across various connected systems [2]. It integrates seamlessly with Google Workspace, but crucially, also supports major third-party enterprise systems like Microsoft 365, Salesforce, and SAP, making it highly adaptable for diverse technology environments [1, 2, 4, 5].\n\nA core component of Gemini Enterprise is its focus on AI agents. These are specialized AI tools designed to perform specific tasks. The platform includes a library of Google-made, pre-built agents for functions such as deep research, data analysis, coding, and customer engagement [2, 4]. More importantly for many businesses, it features a no-code agent workbench, allowing business users to easily build and deploy their own custom AI agents without requiring extensive coding knowledge [1, 4, 5]. This democratizes AI creation, empowering teams across departments—from marketing and finance to HR and IT—to automate complex workflows tailored to their specific needs [1, 4, 5].\n\nBeyond agents, Gemini Enterprise enhances existing Google Workspace tools. For instance, Google Meet now offers real-time translation that captures the speaker's tone and inflection, making global communication more natural. Google Vids can transform static documents or slide decks into engaging videos with AI-generated scripts and voiceovers [1, 5].\n\nSecurity and governance are built into the platform, addressing key concerns for businesses. Gemini Enterprise provides centralized control over agents, permissions, and policies, ensuring data access is managed in compliance with organizational rules. Notably, in its paid editions, Google affirms that customer data—including prompts and outputs—is owned by the customer and is not used to train Google's models or models for other customers [4].\n\nFor small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), Google offers the Gemini Business edition, starting at $21 per user per month, with a 30-day free trial available [2, 4, 5]. This tier provides access to key functionalities like chat, enterprise search, and agent orchestration, along with built-in security. For larger organizations requiring advanced IT controls and compliance features, Gemini Enterprise Standard and Plus editions are available at $30 per user per month [2, 4]. This unified platform, with its open ecosystem and partner integrations, aims to accelerate outcomes, boost productivity, and foster creativity by putting \"the platform, not just the models,\" directly into the hands of every employee [1, 2, 4].\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] Google Introduces Gemini Enterprise to Streamline AI Across ... — reworked.co\n[2] Google rolls out Gemini Enterprise, a unified AI platform for work — maginative.com\n[3] Google debuts Gemini Enterprise, a unified AI platform for businesses — siliconangle.com\n[4] Gemini Enterprise: Best of Google AI for Business — cloud.google.com\n[5] Google Gemini's 10 New AI Product Launches, Programs And News — crn.com"

          "output": "## Global AI Investment Trends\n\nGlobal investment in Artificial Intelligence is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, marking a transformative era for businesses worldwide. In 2025, AI startups alone attracted a staggering $89.4 billion in global venture capital, accounting for 34% of all VC investment despite representing just 18% of funded companies [4]. This substantial capital infusion is complemented by Big Tech's commitment, with over $300 billion in planned spending for 2025 alone, underscoring AI's potential to revolutionize nearly every aspect of life and work [1].\n\nNorth America currently leads in absolute AI funding, while Europe demonstrates the strongest growth momentum with a 41% year-over-year increase, driven by emerging AI hubs and robust government support. Conversely, China experienced a decrease in AI startup funding in 2025 [4]. A significant trend is the rise of corporate venture capital, which now constitutes 43% of AI startup funding, reflecting established technology companies' strategic imperative to acquire AI capabilities [4]. Governments worldwide are also investing heavily in \"sovereign AI\" initiatives, recognizing AI as a critical component of national security and economic power, which contributes to the fragmentation of global technology supply chains [2, 4].\n\nThe lion's share of this investment is flowing into Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), which saw a remarkable 167% year-over-year growth and accounted for 26% of total AI funding in 2024. AI infrastructure and hardware sectors are experiencing the fastest growth rates as the market matures and the need for robust computing power escalates [4]. However, this rapid expansion comes with significant challenges: Bain & Company projects that $2 trillion in new revenue will be needed by 2030 to fund the escalating demand for AI compute power, with an anticipated $800 billion shortfall even if companies fully reinvest AI-related savings [2]. AI's compute demand is growing at more than twice the rate of Moore’s Law, straining global supply chains for critical commodities like copper, nickel, and silicon, as well as energy and transportation sectors [1, 2].\n\nFor small-business leaders, navigating this landscape means understanding both the opportunities and the risks. AI startup valuations are currently commanding premiums, averaging 3.2 times higher than traditional tech companies, driven by expectations of exponential scaling and winner-take-all market dynamics [4]. Investors are increasingly scrutinizing business models for sustainability and defensible competitive advantages beyond just algorithms [4]. A key concern for investors, and therefore for businesses, is the ability to attract and retain scarce AI talent, which is a major risk factor impacting valuations [4]. While AI is an undeniable trend, successful thematic investing remains challenging. Some AI-related themes, such as Future Mobility and Robotics & Automation, have even outperformed broader AI indexes due to specific mega-cap stock performances (like Nvidia), highlighting that not all AI investments yield equal returns [3]. High correlations between many thematic investments and the broader market also prompt questions about their true diversification benefits [3].\n\nAs AI continues its \"warp speed\" expansion into every industry [1], small businesses must strategically assess how to leverage AI without overextending resources, focusing on clear paths to profitability and building strong, talented teams in a competitive environment.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n[1] AI Investing Trends: Latest Developments and Outlook — ml.com (Merrill Lynch)\n[2] $2 trillion in new revenue needed to fund AI's scaling trend — bain.com (Bain & Company)\n[3] The Investment Themes That Are Outperforming AI — morningstar.com (Morningstar)\n[4] Top 100 AI Startup Funding & Investment Statistics [2025] — secondtalent.com (SecondTalent)"
