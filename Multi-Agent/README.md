# ü§ñ Multi-Agent ‚Äî README

## üß† Overview
**Multi-Agent** is an **interactive AI automation workflow** designed for **n8n**, enabling intelligent, multi-tool conversational capabilities through **Google Gemini (PaLM)** and integrated Google Workspace tools.  
It acts as a **smart assistant** that can **chat with users**, **remember context**, **retrieve data from Google Sheets**, and **manage events in Google Calendar** ‚Äî all through a single conversational interface.

This workflow demonstrates how to build a **multi-agent AI system** inside n8n, where different ‚Äútools‚Äù (like calendar and sheet access) can be used automatically based on the user‚Äôs request.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Summary

### **1. When Chat Message Received**
* **Node:** `When chat message received`
* **Type:** `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.chatTrigger`
* **Purpose:** Triggers the workflow whenever a new chat message is received.
* **Usage:** Acts as the main entry point for user interactions in a chatbot or AI interface.

---

### **2. Google Gemini Chat Model**
* **Node:** `Google Gemini Chat Model`
* **Type:** `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.lmChatGoogleGemini`
* **Purpose:** Provides the **AI language model** backbone that powers all conversational and reasoning abilities.
* **Credentials:** Uses the connected **Google Gemini (PaLM)** API account.
* **Function:** Generates intelligent, natural responses and can interpret multi-step instructions.

---

### **3. Simple Memory**
* **Node:** `Simple Memory`
* **Type:** `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.memoryBufferWindow`
* **Purpose:** Enables **short-term memory** by storing the **last 10 messages** of conversation.
* **Function:** Helps maintain conversational context ‚Äî so the AI can remember what was said earlier and respond accordingly.

---

### **4. AI Agent**
* **Node:** `AI Agent`
* **Type:** `@n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent`
* **Purpose:** The central **multi-agent controller** that orchestrates all actions between chat input, memory, and external tools.
* **System Message:**  
  > ‚ÄúYou are a helpful assistant!‚Äù
* **Functions:**
  - Processes incoming chat messages  
  - Maintains memory and context  
  - Calls appropriate tools dynamically based on user intent  
  - Returns a coherent, context-aware response

---

### **5. Get-Contact-Data (Google Sheets Tool)**
* **Node:** `Get-Contact-Data`
* **Type:** `n8n-nodes-base.googleSheetsTool`
* **Purpose:** Allows the AI Agent to **fetch specific data** (e.g., contact or patient info) from a connected Google Sheet.
* **Sheet Info:**
  - **Document ID:** `1zaLX0NAbyCctRppiRhrW0q8BRAPHEigtDDXsPK-6daA`
  - **Sheet Name:** `Contacts_CSV_template`
* **Use Case Example:**  
  ‚ÄúFind the record for patient *John Doe*‚Äù or ‚ÄúCheck the contact details for *Client X*.‚Äù

---

### **6. Event-Manager (Google Calendar Tool)**
* **Node:** `Event-Manager`
* **Type:** `n8n-nodes-base.googleCalendarTool`
* **Purpose:** Allows the AI Agent to **create events** in Google Calendar automatically.
* **Description:** ‚ÄúCreate an event in Google Calendar.‚Äù
* **Credentials:** Uses the connected **Google Calendar OAuth2** account.
* **Use Case Example:**  
  ‚ÄúSchedule a meeting for tomorrow at 10 AM‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdd a reminder for next Friday.‚Äù

## üß© Node Connections

| From | To | Connection Type | Purpose |
|------|----|-----------------|----------|
| When chat message received | AI Agent | `main` | Sends the user‚Äôs message to the AI |
| Google Gemini Chat Model | AI Agent | `ai_languageModel` | Provides LLM capabilities |
| Simple Memory | AI Agent | `ai_memory` | Enables conversational memory |
| Event-Manager | AI Agent | `ai_tool` | Enables event scheduling via Calendar |
| Get-Contact-Data | AI Agent | `ai_tool` | Enables data lookup via Google Sheets |

---

## üß± How It Works

1. A user sends a **chat message** (via webhook or interface).  
2. The **AI Agent** receives it through the **Chat Trigger** node.  
3. The **Gemini model** interprets and reasons about the query.  
4. The **Memory** node provides previous conversation context.  
5. If the message requires data (e.g., contact info or scheduling), the agent:
   - Queries Google Sheets via **Get-Contact-Data**
   - Or creates events via **Event-Manager**
6. The **AI Agent** synthesizes the result and sends a **natural-language reply**.

---

## üß† Example Interactions

### üîπ Retrieve Data
> **User:** ‚ÄúShow me the contact details for Sarah Parker.‚Äù  
> **AI Agent:** Retrieves the row from the Google Sheet and responds with relevant data.

### üîπ Schedule an Event
> **User:** ‚ÄúSet a meeting with the design team on Monday at 3 PM.‚Äù  
> **AI Agent:** Automatically creates the event in Google Calendar and confirms.

### üîπ Maintain Context
> **User:** ‚ÄúAdd another reminder for the same day.‚Äù  
> **AI Agent:** Uses memory to recall the previous event and adds a new one accordingly.
